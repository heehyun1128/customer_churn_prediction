# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project trained machine learning models to predict customer churn for a bank. The process focused on model inference, and using feature engineering, SMOTE, and Ensembling to improve prediction accuracy for identifying churners.

- Model Inference
  
In this project, various models were trained and evaluated to predict whether customers would churn (indicated by the ‘Exited’ column) based on their features. The models used included:

  1. Logistic Regression
  2. XGBoost
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Random Forest
  5. Naive Bayes
  6. K-Nearest Neighbors
  7. Support Vector Machine
